# CIS5190 - Applied Machine Learning Amazon Fine Food Reviews Project

Our project is based off of https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews.
We are using features (mainly the text and summary) from this data to predict the reviews of Amazon Fine Foods using mutliple different prediction methods.

The files are:
- FeatureEng_BOW.ipynb (Basic feature engineering, and bag of word predictions)
- Word2Vec_Classification.ipynb (Word2Vec embedding approach and slight variations)
- roberta_bert_transformers.ipynb (Transformer based approach, reduced to only the most important results)
